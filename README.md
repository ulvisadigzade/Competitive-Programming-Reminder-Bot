# Competitive-Programming-Reminder-Bot

A smart Java bot designed to help competitive programmers stay sharp by sending personalized reminders for problems theyâ€™ve solved. The bot interacts with you to log your solved problems and lets you set a unique reminder interval for each one, so you never forget to revisit and practice.
